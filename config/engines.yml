# This file lists all the engines available to be run for analysis.
# Each engine must have an image_name and description.
# When a repo has files that match the `enable_patterns` globs, that engine
# will be enabled by default in the codeclimate.yml file. That file will also have
# in it the `default_ratings_paths` globs, which are used during analysis to
# determine which files should be rated.
